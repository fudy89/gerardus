The latest version of the code can be [checked-out using subversion](http://code.google.com/p/gerardus/source/checkout).

Gerardus contains Matlab function that can be run directly without building any code. There are also C++ programs and C++ MEX files that need to be compiled and installed before they can be run. BuildInstructions explains how to do the latter.

See the most updated list of all available functions:
